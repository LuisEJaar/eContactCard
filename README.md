# eContactCard
This is a fun project that serves as an easy eContactCard. It is a static site that I created from scratch to practice Bootstrap and React.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React

I tried to focus on mainly practicing Bootstrap for the editing and got a good chance to play with the ReactDOM.render() function. I tried to make sure that I exported and imported as much as I reasonably could for practice.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned what its like to use Bootstrap and React on my own outside of a tuto setting.
